Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a researcher at the Strategic Aerospace Initiative (SAI) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) led by Professor [Jaemyung Ahn](http://sai.kaist.ac.kr/professor/). I obtained a master's degree in Aerospace Engineering under the supervision of Professor Ahn who had been a thoughtful advisor during my studies. Prior to this, I completed my mandatory service as a research officer at the Aerospace Technology Research Institute under the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) from 2017 to 2020. During my service, I worked on autonomous mission planning algorithms for UAV operation in dynamic environments. I received my undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering at [KAIST](https://ae.kaist.ac.kr/pages/sub/sub01_01) in 2017. 

My current research interests lie in the intersection between optimization, deep reinforcement learning, and control theory. In particular, I have focused on solving various vehicle routing problems using deep reinforcement learning and its application in UAV autonomy, intelligent decision-making and smart transportation systems.
