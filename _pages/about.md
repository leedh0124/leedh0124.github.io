Hi! Welcome to my website. I am a researcher at the Strategic Aerospace Initiative (SAI) at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) led by Professor [Jaemyung Ahn](http://sai.kaist.ac.kr/professor/). I obtained a master's degree in Aerospace Engineering at [KAIST](https://ae.kaist.ac.kr/pages/sub/sub01_01) under the supervision of Professor Ahn who had been a thoughtful advisor during my studies. Prior to this, I completed my mandatory service as a [research officer](https://www.rond.or.kr/CmsHome/MainDefault.aspx) at the Aerospace Technology Research Institute under the Agency for Defense Development (ADD) from 2017 to 2020. During my service, I worked on autonomous mission planning algorithms for UAV operation in dynamic environments. I received my bachelor's degree in Aerospace Engineering at KAIST in 2017. As an undergraduate research intern, I participated in a Undergraduate Research Participation (URP) program at Unmanned Systems Research Group (USRG) led by Professor [David HyunChul Shim](\http://unmanned.kaist.ac.kr/) in 2016.

My current research interests lie in the intersection between optimization, deep reinforcement learning, and control theory. In particular, I have focused on solving various vehicle routing problems using deep reinforcement learning and its application in UAV autonomy, intelligent decision-making and smart transportation systems.
