## Routing Problems Considering Value System for Exploration Missions (2020-2023)

## Data-Driven Flow Modeling and Analysis (2020-2023)

## Waypoint-Constrained Optimal Control Problem via Interior-point Barrier Method (2021)

## Autonomous Navigation and Mission Management Technology (2017-2020)

## Modular Drone with Self-Configuration Capability (2016)
Modular drone was the first technical project I worked on. This project was carried out as the Undergraduate Research Participation (URP) program in KAIST. In this work, I developed a modular drone which was composed of smaller, individual modules, which when assembled together, achieved a coordinated flight. These individual modules are capable of self-configuration that enables user to assemble them in any fashion. Once power is on, these modules communicate with each other, determine their module IDs based on their location, and perform coordinated flight. Hardware of individual module and bridge which connects each modules are constructed out of a 3D printer.
